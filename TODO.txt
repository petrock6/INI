Need to save all of the ini files separately. There's a fuck ton of files, but we should be able to avoid small ones. 
Set up a SVN repo to have logs of what's been done..
	UPLOAD TO GITHUB REPO 

To add a special power to a unit;
	Data\ini\commandbutton.ini
		 commandset.ini
		 specialpower.ini
	Tie in w/ objcet files
	
Missile Defender - claymore mine
		 - think we need to make him a dozer?
			- looks like the button is disabled. 
			- look @ how structures are created.. 
				- look @ how the structures lok in code. can't seem to find them...?
				- they're in factionbuilding.ini
			- instead of using mines, let's use very scaled back demo trap. enough to kill a battlemaster, no more. 
Path Finder - Snipe building (1 unit at a time if possible)
	    - allow to snipe bikes
Pilot - Given pistol, immediately runs to base?
	see if we can give pilot the ranger gun or something

     Colonel Burton -- needs to only be able to satchel charge vehicles. 
     
strategy center 20% speed increase
rebel throws molotov cocktail
sentry drone upgrade to shoot shells
